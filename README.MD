## Typography

- I wanted a font that would be clear for users to read with no difficulty and for it to have a distinct identity for the Work It brand.
- I used Google Fonts to choose a font that was modern and fresh.
- The generic sans-serif was used as a backup font for users who did not have the google font.
- For logos, that replaced writing for a more visual aspect, I used Font Awesome.
