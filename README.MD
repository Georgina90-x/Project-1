## Mockup Of Designs / Wireframes

- I used a simple drawing application on iPad in order to visualise how I wanted the Work It website to look, with a simple structure.
- I liked the layout of the Love Running Project and used this as a skeleton for the project and then built upon that.

## User Experience

- The website is designed to clearly show where to access the information most in demand from visitors to gym websites.
- The website has a simple colour scheme that does not cause a sensory overload or detract users from accessing the information they want.
- There are a minimal number of navigation pages so users have a pleasant browsing experience.

## Colour Scheme

- The colour scheme is simple and uses colours that compliment each other.
- A primary colour was chosen as a 'brand' for Work It Gyms that will flow through the entire website.
- (https://coolors.co) was used to help create a suitable colour scheme for the website.
- I kept the colour scheme simple to two colours with a white background. The colours complimented eachother and did not distract from the websites purpose of providing clear information for the user.

- `#656256` used for primary text.
- `#ff7733` used for primary highlights.

## Typography

- I wanted a font that would be clear for users to read with no difficulty and for it to have a distinct identity for the Work It brand.
- I used Google Fonts to choose a font that was modern and fresh and settled on Manrope.
- The generic sans-serif was used as a backup font for users who did not have the google font.
- For logos, that replaced writing for a more visual aspect, I used Font Awesome. 

[Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope?preview.text=Work%20It%20Gyms) was used for all text within the website.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) was used to provide the icons for the home page and contact page.
